# Pedri Detection with YOLOv5

Welcome to **Pedri-Detection-YOLOv5**, a computer vision project that detects FC Barcelona's star midfielder, Pedri, in match footage using YOLOv5. This educational effort explores sports analytics through a single Jupyter notebook, combining data augmentation, model training, and video detection.

## Project Overview
This repository uses YOLOv5 to identify Pedri in a Barcelona game video, trained on a custom dataset of annotated images. Itâ€™s a proof-of-concept with practical potential:
- **Sports Analytics**: Track player movement for tactical insights.
- **Fan Engagement**: Generate highlight clips.
- **Broadcast Tech**: Enable real-time player tagging.

*Note*: The video used is for educational purposes only, with no commercial intent.


Results
-Training: 151 images (augmented to ~300), 100 epochs, mAP50: 0.32.
-Detection: Pedri detected in some frames, but inconsistent
